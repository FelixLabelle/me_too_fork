This repository contains code for Contextual Affective Analysis:A Case Study of People Portrayals in Online #MeToo Stories (ICWSM 2019).

The files src/raw_frames_pipeline.sh and src/full_pipeline.sh contain example pipelines for using the provided scripts. Note that these scripts have NOT been tested for end-to-end running and are instead intended to demonstrate example usage. All publically available data is located in the data directory, and code is located in the src directory. Paths to data will need to be set in src/config.py in order to run most scripts.
